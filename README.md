# Learn Three.js

This project is a tool to help me, and hopefully others, learn about
[Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

The documentation for Three.js is sparse, and you must learn from
the examples. The examples however, are not comprehensively documented,
so it can be difficult. My aim is to learn about Three.js using the 
official examples, and source code, and create 2 types of documentation,
examples and articles.

## Examples

I will be creating several example projects using Three.js. These examples are
weitten in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), and are
thoroughly documented.

The code is in /examples/src

## Articles

Articles are documents that explaing techniques of common actions and patterns
in Three.js. They will include code snippets, as well as explanations of the code
to the best of my understanding.


## About Me

I am [Jim Hoskins](http://jimhoskins.com), and I am a developer and teacher at
[Think Vitamin Membership](http://membership.thinkvitamin.com). I am really 
interested in learning Three.js, but the lack of documentation and articles
makes it a pretty large undertaking. I hope that this project serves as 
documentation for others wanting to learn.

I have a lot of experience with JavaScript and web development, but limited 
experience in 3D programming. In college, I worked on a game using the OGRE
engine in C++, and I took one computer graphics course, in which I worked
on a special project with my Professor using WebGL, instead of C/OpenGL.
I have a very limited understanding of 3D/OpenGL, so if you are new to
3D, these resouces are written for you. I will not be explaing JavaScript
or CoffeeScript however.

## Contributing

As stated before, I am a novice in terms of 3d and OpenGL/WebGL, and my 
explanations are only to the best of my understanding. If you find an 
error, or have a better explanation of a concept, please feel free to 
contribute.

You can reach me on Github at jimrhoskins or on twitter @jimrhoskins.

## Support

This project is primarily to help me learn Three.js, but hopefully they 
are of use to others. That said, I can't guarantee any support of the
examples given in this repository. I spend a lot of my day teaching and 
supporting at Think Vitamin, so I don't have a lot of free time to answer
questions, but I will try. The best way to ask a question is via Github
Issues for this project, that way the answer can be shared publicly.
